Rally Iteration Dashboard
======================

![Title](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/IterationDashboard/master/screenshots/title-screenshot.png)

## Overview

The Iteration Dashboard app displays iteration data in several formats, including pie charts, a general health summary, and an advanced burndown chart. You may view the progress in the iteration broken down by work item type and state.

## How to Use

### Running the App

If you want to start using the app immediately, create an Custom HTML app on your Rally dashboard. Then copy App.html from the deploy folder into the HTML text area. That's it, it should be ready to use. See [this](http://www.rallydev.com/help/use_apps#create) help link if you don't know how to create a dashboard page for Custom HTML apps.

Or you can just click [here](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/IterationDashboard/master/deploy/App.html) to find the file and copy it into the custom HTML app.

### Using the App

In this app, you can see:

* Pie charts displaying the state of user stories, defects, defect suites, and test cases
* An iteration health summary, which calculates the rate of work acceptance to provide general guidance on the iteration
* An advanced burndown chart with color-coding of work by state

## Customize this App

You're free to customize this app to your liking (see the License section for details). Since this app uses a very old version of Rally's SDK, the app is only presented in its deployed form.
